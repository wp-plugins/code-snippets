An easy, clean and simple way to add code snippets to your site.

== Description ==

**Code Snippets** is an easy, clean and simple way to add code snippets to your site. No need to edit to your theme's `functions.php` file again!

A snippet is a small chunk of PHP code that you can use to extend the functionality of a WordPress-powered website; essentially a mini-plugin with a lot less load on your site. Most snippet-hosting sites tell you to add snippet code to your active theme's `functions.php` file, which can get rather long and messy after a while. Code Snippets changes that by providing a GUI interface for adding snippets and actually running them on your site as if they were in your theme's `functions.php` file.

You can use a graphical interface similar to the Plugins menu to manage, activate, deactivate, edit and delete your snippets. Easily organise your snippets by adding add a name and description using the visual editor. Code Snippets includes built-in syntax highlighting and other features to help you write your code. Snippets can be exported for transfer to another side, either in XML for later importing by the Code Snippets plugin, or in PHP for creating your own plugin or theme.

Although Code Snippets is designed to be easy-to-use and its interface looks, feels and acts as if it was a native part of WordPress, each screen includes a help tab, just in case you get stuck.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Further documentation available on the [plugin website](http://cs.bungeshea.com/docs/).

= Do I need to include the `&lt;?php`, `&lt;?` or `?&gt;` tags in my snippet? =
No, just copy all the content inside those tags.

= Is there a way to add a snippet but not run it right away? =
Yes. Just add it but do not activate it yet.

= What do I use to write my snippets? =
The [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) source-code editor will add line numbers, syntax highlighting, search, tabulate and other cool features to the code editor.

= Will I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress? =
No, the snippets are added to the WordPress database so are independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.

= Can the plugin be completely uninstalled? =
Yes, when you delete Code Snippets using the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress it will clean up the database table and a few other bits of data. Be careful not to remove Code Snippets using the Plugins menu unless you want this to happen.

= Can I copy any snippets I've created to another WordPress site? =
Yes! You can individually export a single snippet using the link below the snippet name on the 'Manage Snippets' page or bulk export multiple snippets using the 'Bulk Actions' feature. Snippets can later be imported using the 'Import Snippets' page by uploading the export file.

= Can I export my snippets to PHP for a site where I'm not using the Code Snippets plugin? =
Yes. Click the checkboxes next to the snippets you want to export, and then choose 'Export to PHP' from the Bulk Actions menu and click Apply. The generated PHP file will contain the exported snippets' code, as well as their name and description in comments.

= Can I run network-wide snippets on a multisite installation? =
You can run snippets across an entire multisite network by 'Network Activating' Code Snippets through the Network Dashboard.

= I have an idea for a cool feature for Code Snippets! =
That's great! Let me know by starting (or adding to) a topic in the [Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/code-snippets/).

= I want to contribute to and help develop the Code Snippets plugin! =
