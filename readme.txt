Allows you to easily add code snippets through a GUI interface.

== Description ==

**Code Snippets** is a easy, clean and simple way to add code snippets to your site. 

Use the top level menu to manage your snippets. You can activate, deactivate, edit and delete snippets using a page similar to the Plugins menu. You can add a name for your snippet, a description using the visual editor and the code using a textarea with syntax highlighting and other features.

Snippets are stored in the `wp_snippets` table in the WordPress database (the table name may differ depending on what your table prefix is set to).

Code Snippets will automaticly clean ut its data when deleted through the WordPress dashboard. Each screen includes a help tab just in case you get stuck.

Further information and screenshots are available on the [plugin homepage](http://bungeshea.wordpress.com/plugins/code-snippets).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to include the &lt;?php, &lt;?, ?&gt; tags in my snippet? =
No, just copy all the content inside those tags.

= Is there a way to add a snippet but not run it right away? =
Yes. Just add it but do not activate it yet.

= What do I use to write my snippets? =
The [EditArea](http://www.cdolivet.com/editarea/) source-code editor will add line numbers, syntax highlighting, search and replace, tablature and other cool features to the code editor.

= Will I lose my snippets if I change the theme or upgrade WordPress? =
No, the snippets are added to the WordPress database so are independent of the theme and unaffected by WordPress upgrades.

= Can the plugin be completely uninstalled? =
Yes, when you delete Code Snippets using the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress it will clean up the database table and a few other bits of data. Be careful not to remove Code Snippets using the Plugins menu unless you want this to happen.

= Can I copy any snippets I've created to another WordPress site? =
The import/export feature is currently in development. You can however, use the export feature of phpMyAdmin to copy the `wp_snippets` table to another WordPress database.

= Can I run network-wide snippets on a multisite installation? =
No, this feature is currently not avalible and will be coming in a future release. In the mean time activate Code Snippets individualy on the desired sites.
